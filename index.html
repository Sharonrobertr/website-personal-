			<h2><u>My Projects</u></h2>
			
					<h3>Project 1</h3>
					<p>Details about the project - I developed an object detection system using Python and the OpenCV library. The system uses a pre-trained YOLOv3 model to detect objects in input images, including their class, confidence score, and bounding box coordinates. The system can be extended to detect objects in real-time video streams and can be trained on custom datasets for specific applications. This project has applications in self-driving cars, security systems, and robotics.</p>
					
						<li>Project name: Object-Detection System</li>
						<li>IDE: Jupyter Notebook</li>
						<li>Programming Language: Python</li>

					</ul>
				<br>
				
					<h3>Project 2</h3>
					<p>Details about the project - Using a Trained model with Computer Vision Techniques I collected various datasets of images of various animal species which was present on Kaggle, from that by the help of kaggle api key imported these datasets to my Google Colab notebook and did some processing and merged them to make a single dataset then divided whole dataset into train and test dataset.I imported the live stream video from that application to my system and then each frame of that video was captured and processed and for each frame by the help of my model I find which animal species was present in that particular frame on real time.</p>
